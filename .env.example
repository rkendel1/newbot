# Funding Rate Arbitrage Bot - Configuration Template
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values
#
# This bot implements U.S.-legal funding rate arbitrage between:
# - Apex Omni (Decentralized Exchange on StarkEx L2)
# - Coinbase Perpetual Futures (U.S.-regulated CEX)

# ========== APEX OMNI CONFIGURATION ==========
# Apex Omni is a decentralized exchange (StarkEx L2)
# Benefits: No KYC required, non-custodial, accessible to US users
# 
# HOW TO GET YOUR APEX OMNI CREDENTIALS:
# 1. Go to https://pro.apex.exchange
# 2. Connect your Ethereum wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
# 3. Generate or import your StarkEx key pair:
#    - The platform will help you generate a StarkEx private/public key pair
#    - OR you can import an existing StarkEx key
#    - CRITICAL: Save your StarkEx private key securely - you cannot recover it
# 4. Complete L2 onboarding to get your Account ID
# 5. Your Position ID is typically 0 for new accounts
# 
# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# - StarkEx keys are different from your Ethereum wallet keys
# - You need both private and public StarkEx keys for signing orders
# - Account ID is your unique identifier on the Apex L2 network
# - Position ID is usually 0 unless you have multiple sub-accounts
# - All orders on Apex require StarkEx signature (cryptographic signing)
